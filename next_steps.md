- Define the "kv store" interface precisely and implement
    it for in memory and on disk
  
- Can we test the on disk case? May need yet another interface :(

- Write the DStore backed by disk

- Write the code to collect DFiles into AFiles

- Write the AStore backed by disk

- Metrics for disk usage

- At this point deploy it I think, we have 160gb on disk
